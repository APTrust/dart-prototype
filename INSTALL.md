Mac Users: We're in the process of getting an Apple developer's certificate,
but we're not there yet. For now, you'll see a message saying that this
application is from an unknown developer.

So, the first time you run DART, youâ€™ll need to:

1. Go to the Applications folder in the Finder and find the DART app.
2. Right click on the DART icon (shown above).
3. Choose Open from the menu.
4. Click Open.
